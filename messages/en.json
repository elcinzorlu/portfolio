      "details": "Enucuzu.com is a web and mobile application where users can purchase flight and bus tickets, as well as make hotel and car rental reservations. I took part in various backend modules of this application. We developed the Enucuzu project using the Go programming language with a microservices architecture.\n\n We containerized the project with Docker and used NATS for inter-service communication. We stored our data in PostgreSQL as the RDBMS and used Redis as a caching mechanism.\n\n I contributed to the integration of external providersâ€™ APIs into our system, including Biletbank for flights, Obilet and Pamukkale for bus tickets, Yolcu360 for car reservations, and Otelz and Amadeus for hotel bookings.\n\n I developed the service responsible for generating PDFs of purchased tickets or reservations on the backend using Goâ€™s dynamic template system, and designed the PDF layout with HTML and CSS. \n\nI also played a major role in building the Enucuzu Admin Panel, a separate project where data analytics, all user roles, and permissions can be managed and monitored."
